Breast Cancer Classification: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Analysis for Predictive Modeling
# In this project, the objective is to classify breast cancer cases using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predictive modeling. KNN is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to the labeled training data.By applying the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify breast cancer cases, this project aims to provide predictive modeling capabilities for accurate diagnosis. The results can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, identifying potential malignancies, and improving patient care and treatment strategies.
